=================

The file sensorAverages contains the mean for each combination of subject and activity from the UCI HAR Dataset. The original data set and related information can be found at:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

A subset of the original variables was selected for this aggregate data set. Only those variables which name contained mean() and std() were selected. the average of the mean and standard deviation is present on this file for each of the following measurements.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

==================
Variable names
==================

Bellow are all the column names in the data set:

"activity" Is the lable for the activity variable
"subject"  Subject ID of one of the 30 participants
"activityID" ID integer for the activity variable

The measures below refer to the mean or standard deviation for each one of the above mentioned measurements in the X, Y and Z axis for different observations of each subject and activity from the experiment which data we have consolidated and loaded into memory.

Script tasks overview
========================

The run_analysis.R script found here: https://github.com/luisefigueroa/datasciencecoursera/tree/master/Getting%20and%20Cleaning%20Data performs 5 high level steps.

Step 0 reads the files listed below into data frame objects in memory:

Activity_labels.txt
Features.txt
Subject_test.txt
X_test.txt
Y_test.txt
X_train.txt
Y-train.txt

In this step the data from the features file is also converted into a vector named featuresVector. The featuresVector is used to properly name the variables from the X_test and X_train data sets containing of the observations. 

Step 1 uses the cbind and rbind functions to combine the different data sets for test and training observations and then it combines those into the sensorData super set containing all the observations from all files as well as the corresponding activity id. cbind and rbind functions where used to leverage the fact that the data in the source files is sorted as arrays where the first row of the Y_activity and subject files corresponded to the IDs for the first row of the X_activity files for both the train subset and the test subsets.

Step 2 extracts only the variables that included the mean() and std() substrings in their name while preserving the ActivityID and subjectID.

Step 3 uses the merge command to do the equivalent of a join operation between the sensorData and the activity_labels data in order to add the activity labels to the sensorData super set.

Step 4 of the project instructions was to appropriately able the variables. This was done in step 0 when the data was loaded. 

Step 5 Creates a second data set named sensorAverages from the sensorData that aggregates the observations by activity and subject and produces the mean for all the variables. Finally it writes it uses the write.table function to write the sensorAverages data set to disk.

=================

The file sensorAverages contains the mean for each combination of subject and activity from the UCI HAR Dataset. The original data set and related information can be found at:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

A subset of the original variables was selected for this aggregate data set. Only those variables which name contained mean() and std() were selected. the average of the mean and standard deviation is present on this file for each of the following measurements.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

==================
Variable names
==================

Bellow are all the column names in the data set:

"activity" Is the lable for the activity variable
"subject"  Subject ID of one of the 30 participants
"activityID" ID integer for the activity variable

The measures below refer to the mean or standard deviation for each measurement in the data set for each combination of subject and activity.

Unites of measure
======================
 

All variable names containing the substring Acc are represented in standard gravity units 'g'. 


All variable names containing the substring Gyro are in represented in radians/second.
